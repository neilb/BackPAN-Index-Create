=head1 NAME

BackPAN::Index::Create - generate an index file for a BackPAN mirror

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use BackPAN::Index::Create qw/ create_backpan_index /;

 create_backpan_index({
      basedir       => '/path/to/backpan'
      releases_only => 0 | 1,
      output        => 'backpan-index.txt',
      order         => 'dist' # or 'author' or 'age'
 });

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<BackPAN::Index::Create> provides a function C<create_backpan_index()>
that will create a text index file for a BackPAN CPAN mirror.
A BackPAN CPAN mirror is like a regular CPAN mirror, but it has everything
that has ever been released to CPAN.
The canonical BackPAN mirror is L<backpan.perl.org|http://backpan.perl.org>.

By default the generated index will look like this:

 #FORMAT 1
 authors/id/B/BA/BARBIE/Acme-CPANAuthors-British-1.01.meta.txt 1395991503 1832
 authors/id/B/BA/BARBIE/Acme-CPANAuthors-British-1.01.readme.txt 1395991503 1912
 authors/id/B/BA/BARBIE/Acme-CPANAuthors-British-1.01.tar.gz 1395991561 11231

The first line is a comment that identifies the revision number of the index format.
For each file in the BackPAN mirror the index will then contain one line.
Each line contains three items:

=over 4

=item * path

=item * timestamp

=item * size (in bytes)

=back

=head1 ARGUMENTS

The supported arguments are all shown in the SYNOPSIS.

=head2 basedir

The path to the top of your BackPAN repository, without a trailing slash.

=head2 releases_only

If the C<releases_only> option is true, then the index will only contain
release tarballs, and the paths won't include the leading C<authors/id/>:

 #FORMAT 1
 B/BA/BARBIE/Acme-CPANAuthors-British-1.01.tar.gz 1395991561 11231

=head2 output

The path to the file where the index should be generated.
If the file already exists, it will be over-written.

=head2 order

Specifies what order the entries should be written to the index in.
Currently supported values are:

=over 4

=item * 'dist'

Entries are sorted first by dist name (as determined by L<CPAN::DistnameInfo>,
and then by age. This means that when processing the file, you'll see
entries dist by dist, and within each dist you'll see them in order they
were released.

=item * 'author'

Entries are sorted first by author, and then by filename.
This will cluster files from the same release.

=item * 'age'

Entries are sorted first by age, and then by filename.
Given that filenames are unique on CPAN, this should give
a deterministic result for a specific BackPAN.

=back

The supported sort orders are defined by plugins in the
C<BackPAN::Index::Create::OrderBy> namespace. 
C<Dist.pm>, C<Author.pm>, and C<Age.pm> are included in the base distribution.
If you have installed additional plugins, they'll be automatically available.

Note: CPAN::DistnameInfo doesn't handle paths for files other than
tarballs, so if you generate a full index, you may not get the results
you expect.

=head1 Note for Windows users

On Windows the generated index will use '/' as the directory separator,
as I I<think> that's the right thing to do.
Please let me know if you think I'm wrong.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<create-backpan-index> - a script that provides a command-line interface
to this module, included in the same distribution.

L<BackPAN::Index> - an interface to an alternate BackPAN index.
